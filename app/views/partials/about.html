<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is just a little utility I wrote for fun and for me.</p>

<p>It's all the functionality that I ever want in a bixi/bike-share app, and it's pretty darn fast at doing what I need.</p>

<p>If you like it, feel free to fill my tip jar.</p>
<p>If you're a coder, feel free to check out the source on github.</p>
<p>If you have no idea what this is, don't worry too much about it.</p>
